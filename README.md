## Countle Legacy

This version of Countle is a reworked version of the original, which is now [archived on GitHub]("https://github.com/lcpdecastro/countle-legacy") but can still be accessed [here]("https://countle-legacy.vercel.app").

Note that the legacy version of Countle has a faulty Numbers solver which fails to find solutions to some otherwise solvable puzzles, an issue which is fixed in this new version.
